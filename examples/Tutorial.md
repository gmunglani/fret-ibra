# Tutorial
The config file (.cfg) contains parameters including the path to the image stack files, the range of frames to be processed, and multiple other options for each module. A log file with details on the input parameters is updated after each module run. The *Config_tutorial.cfg* file in this folder is used to demonstrate the functionality of this toolkit. 

Before processing, the donor and acceptor channel image stacks should be renamed to the following format
```txt
Acceptor *file_identifier*_YFP.tiff
Donor    *file_idenfitier*_CFP.tiff
```
First, the *input_path* (full or relative) and *filename* parameters needs to be set.
```txt
input_path = ./examples/stack 
filename = Test
```

The range of frames to be processed is then stated with the parameter *continuous_range*. If individual frames are desired, then the *manual_frames* parameter is set with comma-separated values. 

*continuous_range* is only functional when the first frame entry in *manual_frames* is set to 0.
```txt
continuous_range = 1:6
manual_frames = 0
```

## Background Subtraction
The user then has the option to run one of three modules. The *background* subtraction module should be run first.
```txt
background = 1
ratio = 0
bleach = 0
```

The background module parameters include the *window* (or tile) size (in pixels) to divide the frame into smaller parts and the acceptor and donor channel *eps* values for the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

Note, that the higher the *eps* value, the more foreground pixels are included. The two channels can be processed separately, by simply setting the *eps* value to 0 for the other channel.
```txt
window = 40
acceptor_eps = 0.01
donor_eps = 0.01 
```

The background subtraction module can then be run with multiple options including an output HDF5 file (-s) (necessary for further processing), a video animation of per-frame metrics (-a) and a TIFF output file (-t).
```bash
ibra -c Config_tutorial.cfg -a -t -s -v
```

## Ratiometric Processing
Once both donor and acceptor channels have been processed, the *ratio* processing module should be run. The options include cropping (*crop*) the original image to speed up processing time (by the top left and bottom right comma-separated coordinates), image registration (*register*), and overlap correction (*union*). Furthermore, the bit-depth (*resolution*) must be set to either 8, 12, or 16. 

Cropping is not functional for (0,0,0,0). 
```txt
crop = 0,0,0,0
resolution = 12
register = 1
union = 1```

The ratiometric processing module can then be run after *background* is set to 0, and *ratio* to 1. This generates two graphics, which can be used along with the per-frame metrics animated video generated by the background subtraction module to assess if the *eps* value must be redefined for specific frames.

### Median intensity of foreground pixels (non-zero intensity) per frame

## Correcting individual frames
The median intensity and number of foreground pixels clearly show the frame 4 on the YFP (acceptor) stack is a significant outlier. This can be corroborated with the background subtraction animated video. If there is no experimental justification for this outlier, this frame can be corrected individually by re-running the background subtraction algorithm on frame 4 (donor channel only), with a higher *eps* value, followed by re-running the ratiometric processing module.
```txt
continuous_range = 1:6
manual_frames = 4

window = 40
acceptor_eps = 0.03
donor_eps = 0
```

## Bleach correction
Once all unexpected outliers have been corrected, the bleach correction module can (optionally) be run. The median intensity of the foreground in the donor and acceptor image stacks are used to estimate the range of frames between which the bleaching effect can be fit. The type of fit: linear (regularized) or exponential regression must also be given.
```txt
YFP_bleach_range = 1:7
CFP_bleach_range = 1:7
fit = linear
```
